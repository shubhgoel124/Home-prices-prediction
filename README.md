🏡 Bangalore Home Price Prediction (ML Model Only)
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts housing prices in Bangalore based on location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms (BHK). The model is trained on real estate data and uses feature engineering and regression techniques to estimate property prices.

📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can:

Understand location-based housing prices

Predict fair market value based on key property features

Help users make data-driven real estate decisions

📊 Features Used
Location (categorical)

Total Square Footage

Number of Bathrooms

Number of BHK (Bedrooms-Halls-Kitchen)

🛠 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling

Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for EDA and visualization


✅ Steps Performed
Handled missing and inconsistent values

Removed outliers (e.g., price per sqft)

Applied one-hot encoding to locations

Built a Linear Regression model

Performed cross-validation and tuned the model
